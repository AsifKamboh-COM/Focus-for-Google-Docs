  <h1 align="center">Focus for Google Docs</h1>
</p>

Focus is a Chrome extension that simplifies Google Docs by hiding distracting controls to just show the text. It is good for minimalists or those who get easily distracted. It includes a pomodoro timer to motivate you to write continuously for a period of time (e.g. 15 minutes).

## How to Use
Click the extension icon to toggle focus mode.

Click the pomodoro timer in the bottom-right of the Google Doc to start a pomodoro session.

Right-click the extension icon and select "Options" to open the Options page for configuring settings.

Right-click the extension and select "Report a Bug" or "Feedback" to leave feedback. Thank you!
