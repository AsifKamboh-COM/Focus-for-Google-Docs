</p>

Focus is a Chrome extension that simplifies Google Docs by hiding distracting controls to just show the text. It is good for minimalists or those who get easily distracted. It includes a pomodoro timer to motivate you to write continuously for a period of time (e.g. 15 minutes).

## How to Use
Click the pomodoro timer in the bottom-right of the Google Doc to enter focus or start a pomodoro session.

Click the extension icon to modify the settings.

Note: Chrome version of at least 102 is required. If you have Chrome version 94 or earlier, you will have to upgrade Chrome for Focus to work.
